## The Last Two Weeks
In the last two weeks, I've been opportune to do some DevOps related tasks at work. Setting up an extensive Nginx server on Digital Ocean, hosting a Laravel application, Setting up MySql, hosting some internal APIs and creating reverse proxy servers for some of these APIs.

I also got to learn about the main infrastructure used at work and how it's managed (Terraform & Ansible) with some really complex AWS tools &#128554. 

For someone who's closest to DevOps before now was with shared hosting and writing some few Cron jobs, I was somewhat overwhelmed.

## An Epiphany
I decided to become a DevOps Engineer during the week and would be investing my time and resources regularly to achieve this. 
Here's a link to the [plan](https://medium.com/@devfire/how-to-become-a-devops-engineer-in-six-months-or-less-366097df7737) I'd be following. 

I'll make sure to document my progress and write about everything I learn.
