## The Motive

I've always wanted my space. My little cubicle where I get to share everything I learn to people who in their infinite patience would take out time to read my short, yet detailed posts. 

Finally, it's here. Today I launch fairgoat.com officially, to share every struggle, accomplishment, obstacle, memory, and knowledge I get.

Welcome.

Chibuzor Felix, OKEKE.
